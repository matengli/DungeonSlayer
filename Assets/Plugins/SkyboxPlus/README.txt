It encourages us to keep improving it! Also send us your thoughts and suggestions.
Thanks!


Universal Rendering Pipeline (URP)
----------------------------------

Skybox Plus is compatible with built-in and URP pipelines, however the the demo scene included with the asset was created for built-in pipeline.
If you open the demo scene with URP, the terrain won't show correctly (pink) but that's expected. The Skybox Plus materials will work fine in your scene.


Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Skybox Plus will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
